# Uthumer

This little handy script can be used to obtain a full-sized thumbnail of a Youtube video. 

In other words: have you ever stumbled on [an image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-iEK0mlmuQ) so outstanding that it outshines [the wallpaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EL0ENFbm0pghedr3ocFxy21ZuvXDjx70/view) from the greatest narrative game ever created? I wasn't aware that it would be possible, and I consider Uthumer a byproduct of sweeping dust that has been left after I found my mind shattered. I've just felt that I'm getting expotentially better at writting those descriptions.
